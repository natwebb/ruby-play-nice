Play Nice

Purpose

*Play Nice* is a command-line Ruby app that lets old-school tabletop RPG players find rulesets and resources in an easy, intuitive manner. Rulesets are categorized and sorted by their similarity,
allowing gamers to determine how easily different products can be converted to work together. For example, retro-clone games are organized based on their root version of the original fantasy RPG,
with common distinctions such as ascending vs. descending armor class noted.
