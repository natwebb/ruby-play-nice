*User Story* As a player, in order to choose a game to run, I want to freely browse the game database.<br/>
*Acceptance Criteria* Any user should be able to browse every game in the database. They should be organized by the base rules they most closely emulate,
but also have cross-referencing. So for example, a user might choose Basic clones, then choose Labyrinth Lord, then the AEC, then 1e clones, then OSRIC.<br/>
*Usage* In the top menu, choose option 2, Browse games. Choose a base option from the next list, then a specific ruleset from the following list.<br/>
<hr/>

*User Story* As a player, in order to choose a game to run, I want to search games by their rules.<br/>
*Acceptance Criteria* Any user should be able to search for games that fit specific rules desires, for example, ascending armor class. This search will key off particular predetermined rules,
rather than an open-ended text search. It will return a list of games that use that rule.<br/>
*Usage* In the top menu, choose option 3, Search by rules. Choose a key rule from the next list, and choose a rule setting from the final list.<br/>
<hr/>

*User Story* As a player, in order to find new resources for my game, I want to see what rulesets are most compatible to the one I use.<br/>
*Acceptance Criteria* A user should be able to choose his or her own game from the list, and see what rulesets are most similar to it. These should cross-reference
to allow exploration into other rules areas. For example, a user might choose Labyrinth Lord, which is closest to ACKS, BFRPG, Moldvay, and LL AEC. Choosing AEC would link to 1e and OSRIC.<br/>
*Usage* In the top menu, choose option 1, Choose a game. From the next list, choose your preferred game. When a user is browsing through, each other game should list with the similarities
and differences to the starting game.<br/>
<hr/>

*User Story* As a player, in order to find new resources for my game, I want to know how to adapt from one ruleset to another.<br/>
*Acceptance Criteria* The user should be able to select specific rules in order to get instructions on how to convert between rulesets. For example, choosing Armor Class will explain
how to convert from ascending to descending AC.<br/>
*Usage* On any game page, press the appropriate key for a specific rule to get more info about that rule, including conversion notes.<br/>
<hr/>

*User Story* As a user, in order to keep the database up-to-date, I want to add new games and update current game information.<br/>
*Acceptance Criteria* Users should be able to add and update games in the database. Adding a new game should intelligently make sure a game by that name does not already exist, then let the user
set its rules and what game (either base or user-added) it most closely resembles. Updating a game will allow a user to change these same attributes.<br/>
*Usage*In the top menu, choose option 4 to add a game or option 5 to update a game.<br/>
